  <h2></h2>
</div>

Lookahead is an online application that allows students at the University of Melbourne to plan their
semester. A variety of customisations and optimisations are provided to help students make the most
out of their semester.

This project is maintained by students and is unaffiliated with the University. This is a major fork of the [old version](https://github.com/Trontor/lookahead), written by Rohyl J., which is no longer maintained.

**Currently, this fork is a work in progress and is not in a usable state.** A public-facing website will be made available when the fork is updated. If you're interested in joining the team, contact Ollie at [ollie@oyc.id.au](mailto:ollie@oyc.id.au).
